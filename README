Specials Board is based on Ryan Bates' beautiful Railcast Theme for TextMate (http://railscasts.com/about) as well as its inspiration, idlefingers by Damien Timewell (http://fluidsyntax.com/blog/articles/idlefingers-textmate-theme).



Specials Board contains two directories of files. 

The 'native-languages' directory contains replacement .seestyle files for all the default languages that Coda supports. These can be installed without any extra work. Supported languages are:
* ASP-HTML
* ActionScript
* CFML
* CSS
* ERB
* HTML
* JSP-HTML
* Java
* Javascript
* LassoScript
* Objective-J
* PHP-HTML
* Perl
* Ruby
* SQL
* Smarty
* XML

The 'custom-syntax-modes' directory contains .seestyle files for additional modes. See custom mode installation notes below. Custom modes must be installed before .seestyle files can be imported. At this time .seestyle files have been created for the following modes:
* bash 							(CFBundleVersion 1.2)
* GNU gettext strings i18n 		(CFBundleVersion 1.0)
* Makefile 						(CFBundleVersion 1.2)



Installation:

Coda let's you import color sets from an XML file with the extension .seestyle on a per-language basis. To install this seestyle theme, download and unzip the package. Then, open Coda and go to System Preferences > Colors. You might want to go through and back up each of the language sets by clicking Export... When you’re done with that click Import... and choose the files, one at a time to bring in. You'll also want to switch your background color to #2b2b2b and your foreground color to #e6e1dc.



Reverting: 

Whoops, turns out you hate it. And you didn't follow the Export instructions above and you want to go back to the default syntax coloring theme. Alrighty. You can re-download the default set from the 'Community' section of Coda's Developer web site: http://www.panic.com/coda/developer/#community



Custom Mode Installation:

Coda is compatible with SubEthaEdit modes. Information on writing your own mode can be found in the 'How To' section of Coda's Developer web site: http://www.panic.com/coda/developer/#howto

The GNU gettext strings (i18n) and Makefile modes can be downloaded from SubEthaEdit's mode page: http://www.codingmonkeys.de/subethaedit/modes.html

Those get placed in your Library/Application Support/Coda/Modes/ directory.

The bash mode can be extracted from the SubEthaEdit package. View Rogier Spieker's instructions in the Coda Users Google Group under the thread 'Syntax highlighting for shell scripts?' http://groups.google.com/group/coda-users/browse_thread/thread/22c3ff5eefce04ad/dfa3baebaa3afced?pli=1

Please note that these custom modes can be changed which may render the .seestyles differently than anticipated. It's best to check and make sure that the CFBundleVersion matches the one listed next to the language. That info is contained within the info.plist file which can be viewed by expanding the .mode package.
